DESCRIPTION
------------

This small program is mainly an adaptation from: 
https://www.kaggle.com/gspmoreira/recommender-systems-in-python-101#Collaborative-Filtering-model

The dataset used here is nevertheless different.
We used 'Superstore data' found on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/jr2ngb/superstore-data

The goal is to demonstrate to potential Necando customers what a product recommendation engine could look like.
